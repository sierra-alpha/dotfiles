This is a home for all my dot files, some repos such as .emacs have their own
licence files and credits, for everything else assume the GPL3 licenses mentioned
in licences.md

The Dotfiles to get my specific config in <Repo Branch Name>

use to install:

```bash
cd ~/<.dotfiles repo clone location>
stow -t ~ */
```

may need adopt on an already set up machine and then do a git diff to see
the difference. (The trailing slash is to ignore all base level directories).
